     Calamity of The Troupe - an unfinished masterpiece of their leader. Was once raised as their rising star in
     response to the threat that was ${Character.get(NpcId.Ebenezar).createLink("the Lich")}. But turned against them only 
     as he slaughtered all the troupe's senior members in one night and escaped into Materia - sealing his
     memories and powers. He returned to the outer planes by accident and sought out the troupe when he did. 
     Descended into insanity after killing ${Character.get(NpcId.Mouthpiece).createLink("The Mouthpiece")} and inheriting 
     his curse. Following which he stealthily assassinated ${Character.get(NpcId.TraitorOthello).createLink("The Traitor")}, who was 
     preoccupied in fighting 'Agents of the Fifth', thus freeing the Primordial nightmares.
