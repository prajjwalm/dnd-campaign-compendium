    <div class="page_content">
        <h3>Explaining the Shards</h3>
        <p>
            Sixteen shards govern the entire multiverse. As their name suggests they are fragments, pieces of a whole,
            pieces of a God who once was, who predated the multiverse these adventures take place in - a God who was killed.
            Each shard is referred to by an ideal that represents the Shard's primary purpose or motivation. They are the
            final sources and custodians of all energy, all investiture, all magic, even of all space and time itself. Yet,
            to function properly, a shard needs a mind to control it, to direct its actions. A mind belonging to a
            sentient being who 'holds' the shard. Such a person who has taken up the power of a Shard is known as the
            Vessel of that Shard.<br/>
            Shards typically choose their vessels, but regardless the intent and nature of the shard eventually become
            the intent and nature of the vessel, though individuals with strong wills can retain their own
            personality for long, yet even the strongest of wills would eventually find their ideals being twisted to
            match the shard they hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Shards are the most powerful known entities in the multiverse, and for all intents and purposes,
            serve as its Gods. Most powers that mortals and immortals wield alike come from them. Yet some entities,
            aberrations of unknown origin, noticeably do not fall under any of their domains and are not allied with
            any of them, typically. Each shard has a outer plane of their own, though are better linked than others -
            this generally depends on how well the relations between the vessels are.
            For example, Leras and Ati were very close before becoming shards, and so it is possible to go directly from
            the Gardens of Preservation to the Castle of Ruin (but not the other way round) without using
            perpendicularities. Some shards are even said to share planes. Outer planes typically get moulded
            following the nature of the Shard. When creatures of the inner planes die, the Shards may choose to
            summon their souls to their own planes, typically this doesn't involve active action on part of the vessel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all this, the Shards themselves are almost unknown in the inner planes, and completely unknown in
            Materia, the material plane that forms the center of the multiverse. Instead, the pantheon that people
            worship are often aspects of the shard Devotion, who is - behind the veils - the final source of power
            for 'Gods' and their clerics alike. Similarly, other shards also grant powers to creatures - powers far
            beyond commoners, powers that give them supernatural abilities. Some shards' powers typically cause their
            recipients to go down a certain course - like Honor's powers generally give rise to Paladins (aka. Knights
            Radiant), while Ruin's powers generally produce the greatest Rogues.
        </p>
        <h4>The Nature of Investiture</h4>
        <p>
            Shardic powers manifest in the realms as investiture. While it may occur in all physical, cognitive and
            spiritual states, the greatest amount of it is present in its spiritual form. Highly 'invested' people
            are kept alive by the investiture that has become a part of their souls - becoming one of the reasons
            why a high enough level barbarian could survive a fall from outer space while a commoner would die if
            shoved from the fifth floor - even if they had the same hulking body with the same physical anatomy /
            constitution. Investiture also fuels all the abilities that creatures in the multiverse use -
            the ki of monks, the spell slots of wizards, etc. all are representations of how much investiture they hold
            presently.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said some investiture also takes physical forms - like Preservation's mists, Ruin's Atium or Honor's
            'Stormlight' - such investiture can be absorbed by creatures whose souls are invested enough to hold it and
            used to 'recharge' their abilities or grant them new ones. However, investiture of this form is also
            generally tied to the shard, and so can only be absorbed by beings with a connection to them. For
            example, only those bonded with spren can absorb Stormlight, or only those not touched by Ruin (i.e.
            those not pierced by metal) and gifted by Preservation can benefit from the mists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like the shards, the concepts of investiture is almost unknown in Materia, even if they do make use of it in
            rather considerable amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strangely, a metal yet undiscovered in the Material plane - Aluminium - repels investiture in its pure
            state. If some investiture is forced into it anyway (the process being a closely guarded secret), then
            enchanted aluminum becomes a complete void to investiture in all forms.
        </p>
        <h4>Honor's Sacrifice</h4>
        <p>
            Shards are near-infinite in their command over all physical, mental and spiritual. They can move planets
            on a whim, their minds are infinitely expanded and can compute the probabilities of various potential
            routes the future upto centuries may take with near-absolute certainly and they are the owners of all the
            power that circulate in the multiverse. As mentioned above, for all intents and purposes, each of them is
            'God'. Yet they stand with conflicting ideals and natures - and so all conflict between mortals, or even
            immortals, would fade before or be subsumed under a conflict of shards. (Shardic calculations of the
            future, which approach near vision-level of the future gets greatly obfuscated when another being who can
            'see' the future - typically another shard - is involved.)<br/>
            And needless to say, a conflict between shard could've been, and once was near devastating for mortals.
            Plus given that shards were initially all exactly equal in strength, such a conflict would be seen
            through to brutal ends, and to an inconclusive result.
        </p>
        <p>
            So like Preservation had long ago given a piece of himself to form sentient life - becoming weaker than Ruin
            in the process - Honor too made all the shards subject to a pact, a bond, a deal they couldn't refuse
            (and most didn't even want to) at the cost of making himself weaker than other shards. A pact which made
            them unable to use their powers to overwhelm a sentient creature from within the multiverse or use their
            infinite intelligence to trick or outwit it until the creature itself willed so - with full awareness of
            what they asked for. And so, shards were restricted to achieve their ends through sentient, often mortal,
            beings - people whom they would grant help and power in exchange for having them become their agents and
            subject to their authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            This pact was made by invoking powers older than, and stronger than, even Shards themselves - and should
            they violate it, they would immediately become far weaker, and at the mercy of other shards. The same
            went for all future deals between sentient beings and shards. There would be no tricking or wordplay
            involved in such deals - both sides would have full awareness of what the other side asked for and intended.
            Trying to break out of such an oath would weaken the shard by a fair magnitude which depended upon the
            implications of breaking it. If the opposing side were to willingly break the oath, they would instantly
            be obliterated - erased from existence itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite that, such agreements, while not common-place, aren't exactly uncommon either. Even after knowing
            all implications, many mortals find that agreeing is a wiser strategy/tactic than staying away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, things from without are not subject to such restrictions...
        </p>
        <h3>Preservation</h3>
        <p class="cool_intro">
            And in that moment, K. was reminded why he had named this creature a God in the first place. There was an
            infinity beyond those eyes. He was the infinity of a note held perfectly, never wavering. The majesty of a
            painting, frozen and still, capturing a slice of life from a time gone by. It was the power of many, many
            moments compressed somehow into one.

            The sky — misty and shifting — seemed so faint, so distant. It felt as if it had pulled back, like people
            in a crowd shying away from a corpse. In that vastness K. saw something dark, thrashing, writhing upon
            itself. More solid than mist, like an ocean of black snakes slithering across one another, stretching to the
            horizon in all directions, obscuring the tiny sun.</p>

            force that would gleefully take something as simple as darkness, then rip it apart. This force was time
            infinite. It was the winds that weathered, the storms that broke, the timeless waves running slowly,
            slowly, slowly to a stop as the stars and the planets cooled to nothing.</p>

            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>Time flows differently in all realms - the more the shardic focus (i.e. the greater the
               investiture) in a realm / point in space, the faster time moves there. For example time has not moved at
               all in the outer fringes of the Gardens of Preservation, where no shard focuses. So a day there would be
               equivalent to a century in Materia.</p>
            <p>At first, time moved slowest in Materia - since the shards all focused on their realms. But as
               threats from without started to take shape in Materia, and because there was a clash of interests which
               unfolded there, shards shifted their focus completely over there. This reached a climax during the Silent
               Age, where time passed in there nearly a dozen times as fast as in the other planes. After that,
               during the archaic age the shards agreed to step away - causing time in the inner planes to
               drop till it became around half the pace of the mean of the outer planes.</p>
            <p>However, in the last few centuries, Preservation was weakening, again causing time to go slower in the
               Gardens. One day there would roughly be a week in Materia. When the Survivor took up the Shard
               however, he immediately focused on clearing the mess in his domain, which caused time to accelerate
               rapidly in there causing hours spent in Ruin equivalent to weeks in the Gardens.</p>

        <h3>In game rules</h3>
        <p>
            Disclaimer: These rules are based on what I felt should be appropriate based on previous experience.
            While I will generally stick to them, I may occasionally change them based on how the gameplay feels.
            Most of these are addons and interpretations, and should change anything to fundamental to the system.
            These take the last spot because they are entirely system dependant - and not really of much significance
            to the campaign itself. I may change the system, but the characters/shards would remain, while these all
            would become obsolete. To me the system is secondary to the narrative and world building. As
            such I am also typically chill with homebrew as long as I feel it won't reduce the fun other people,
            including myself, are having. <br/>
            Of course, I will continue to add stuff here as we go along.
        </p>

        <h4>AoE attacks with a hit roll</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the times attacks targeting multiple creatures require saving throws, which typically makes
            sense. However, in rare cases, there may be attacks which I feel can cover multiple creatures in their
            impact, yet would be resisted by a sturdy piece of plate armor. Simple examples being the hail of machine
            gun fire or a sweeping blade of a giant. In such case I'll make a single attack roll which would apply to
            the primary target(s) and an amount (typically 0, 2 or 5) subtracted from the roll would apply to
            secondary targets in range.
        </p>
        <h4>Continuous Damage</h4>
        <p>If an effect deals continuous damage, it is approximated dealing D<sub>1</sub> damage in
           initiative counts 24, 16 and 8 and D<sub>2</sub> at initiative count 0, where,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>D<sub>1</sub> is total damage / 4, rounded down.</li>
            <li>D<sub>2</sub> is total damage - 3 &times; D<sub>1</sub>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Hero Points</h4>
        <p>As the protagonists of the game there might be certain points where you might not want to leave things to
        rng and instead reinforce yourselves in heroic moments. So from now on, I'll be giving each pc a certain
        amount of hero points - an amount dependent on the length of the campaign and how major a role I want your
        PCs to play.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use any number of dice to add or subtract to a roll involving your character in any way.</li>
            <li>The first dice is worth as many hero points you started with in total. All subsequent dice are
                worth one less than the previous.</li>
            <li>So, if you had, say, 7 hero points. You could use them all at once to get a total of &plusmn; 28 in a
                single roll, probably upsetting the will of a God, or use them to get &plusmn;7 in 7 different rolls,
                or anything in between.</li>
            <li>These will not replenish in any way whatsoever.</li>
            <li>You can use these in any rolls whatsoever. (Luck rolls will be d100s in the future)</li>
            <li>These add to the NAT roll, and may potentially exceed the max of the dice. And so, for combat
                purposes, any NAT roll &geq; 20 is considered a critical hit in to-hit rolls, and a NAT roll &leq; 1
                is an auto-miss.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that unlike the DMG variant, these do not replenish on level ups. But they grant a much more
           powerful bonus to any roll, and stacking is an option. So use them wisely.</p>

        <h4>Graded rolls</h4>
        <p>
            Unlike the others, this is not entirely homebrew. At times we want effects from a powerful creature where
            we can't have the DC as per the usual formula (not much fun saying you die if you fail a DC 27 save...).
            So like the medusa, several high CR monsters' attacks with ridiculous DCs would have only minor effects if
            you fail the save by a small amount, and increasingly traumatic effects if you fail by more than a
            certain amount.
        </p>

        <h4>Honor, Sanity, Wis, Cha</h4>
        <p>
            Personally, I always found myself confused by when to use Wis vs Cha saving throws. So I decided to
            use the DMG's Honor and Sanity scores to resolve this confusion. Again, any rules I say here are my
            interpretation and may appear ridiculous to others, so I'll include the official words to try to reason
            out my homebrew distinction.
        </p>
        <h6>Official Rules (DMG)</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Wis Saves.</b> <i>"Resisting effects that charm, frighten, or otherwise assault your willpower".</i>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cha Saves.</b> <i>"Withstanding effects, such as possession, that would subsume your personality or
                                     hurl you to another plane of existence".</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now to me, "assault your willpower" and "subsume your personality" sound way too close / ambiguous in
            certain contexts. Willpower I interpret as a measure of how much you can make yourself do something you
            must do even when your mind rebels against you. Will, the same, but towards a specific goal. Lacking them
            means you will waver in your intent (a crucial, perhaps the most crucial, part of your personality) when
            put under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add to the confusion, Paladins, a class that literally derives its power from oaths, use Charisma.
            Oaths to me are the ultimate expression of willpower. To declare words/ideals which you will always
            follow no matter how much your mind, your instincts, even your very soul would crave otherwise. Also,
            quoting from the Stormlight Archive,
        </p>
        <p class="cool_intro">
            "There are no foolish oaths. All are the mark of men and true spren over beasts and subspren. The mark of
             intelligence, free will, and choice."
        </p>
        <h6>Final Rules</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Honor.</b> (aka Willpower)
                A skill whose base value equals your <u>Charisma Save</u>. This score would be used to force
                yourself to do something when your body or mind rebels against it. While this would be called as a
                saving throw most of the time, players can also request a roll of their own violation to resist, in a
                reduced way, the symptoms of effects like fear etc. Players may declare a <u>will</u>, something they
                really, really want from their very soul. On Honor rolls aligning with their will, players will have
                advantage, on those going against it, they'll have disadvantage.<br/>
                Note that the more willpower is used, the greater strain it puts on the mind. And characters might make
                themselves depressed/tired on overuse, particularly on failed rolls, whose mechanical effects I would
                decide when needed.<br/>
                However, successful rolls, particularly in situations that matter, might also eventually grant players
                an increase to the modifier itself.
            </li>
            <li><b>Sanity.</b>
                A skill whose base value equals your <u>Wisdom save</u>. This score would be used only in save-like
                situations, though often out of combat. It would denote how much you can hold on to your mind when
                exposed to the utterly alien/aberrant/powerful, such as the focus of an elder (or worse) nightmare,
                reading the more infernal plays of
                <span class="card_link" data-index-key="[character|Logos]">The Playwright</span>,
                or encountering a more potent vision of a Shard than the mind can handle.<br/>
                Failed rolls will generally incur forms of madness or other insanity, but in more severe cases can lead
                to more drastic effects. For example, being exposed to the full form of an outsider might cause a
                feeblemind while being exposed to the full form of a shard, if it were possible, would be instant
                death.<br/>
                The modifier to this roll also can increase, it increases the more a character is exposed to, in a
                'vaccine-like' manner. It may also decrease when exposed in a harsher way, and greatly decrease if the
                save made to resist it fails.
            </li>
            <li><b>Saves.</b>
                So what do I use the saves for? Firstly and majorly, in combat. Occasionally, I may use them for the
                effects listed in DMG instead of honor/sanity. Wisdom saves will be used to keep your cool, like
                when being charmed (which might include being forced into wrath/bloodlust). Like in the case of
                partly resisting fear, effects of a failed wisdom save could typically be reduced or even nullified by a
                successful subsequent Honor roll, but that would put some strain on the mind. Charisma saves will be
                made to resist personality changes on a core level - like an alignment switch. A rule of thumb will
                be that wisdom saves would target the immediate, while charisma saves would target the long term.

        <h4>Rests and Natural healing</h4>
        <p>
            The reason heroes can fall from 150ft in the air, get slashed on the gut with a longsword and then be up and
            about after a good night's sleep without any healing magic is because of the investiture their bodies hold,
            which allows them to take damage that normally would kill a person. This means that the replenishment of
            their investiture overnight is what natural healing entails. This also means that in areas of reduced
            investiture, natural healing would suffer. Normally, this doesn't affect the game and we can follow the
            basic rules just as usual (since all campaigns happen in the outer planes with a good amount of
            investiture), but in areas of low, high investiture we'd adopt different rule-sets.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Investiture Drained areas.</b> (Materia)
                <ul>
                    <li>Any use of hit dice in short/long rests requires access to a healer's kit or someone with
                        Medicine or nature proficiency.</li>
                    <li>The character doesn't auto-restore full health on a long rest, instead they restore hit dice
                        equal to their class levels / 4, rounded down for each class they have. They must restore at
                        least 1 hit die.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Investiture Void areas.</b> (Areas with high pure Aluminium like the Plane of Innovation)
                <ul>
                    <li>Gritty Realism. Short rests become 8 hours, and long rests become a week.</li>
                    <li>Hit dice do not contribute to max HP which instead becomes 9 + Con Mod. (Or 8 + Con Mod for
                    small size.)</li>
                    <li>Characters restore 1 hp in short rests. This becomes 1d4 if someone has access to a healer's kit
                        or has Medicine proficiency.</li>
                    <li>Characters restore 2 + Con Mod HP in long rests. This becomes 2d4 + Con Mod if someone has
                        access to a healer's kit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Heightened Investiture areas.</b> (Perpendicularities, areas closer to shards / the spiritual realm)
                <ul>
                    <li>Epic Heroism. Short rests become 5 minutes, long rests become 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Healing surges. Characters can use a bonus action to expend 1 hit die for healing.</li>
                    <li>Characters restore hit dice equal to class levels / 4 on a short rest, rules same as above.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>On Insight checks</h4>
        <p>
            Here its probably better if I start with the inspiration for this. So in my experience of the first arc
            of the first campaign, players would "insight check this" everytime an npc said something, or even
            appeared to be, remotely suspicious. Now the npcs of the first arc were generally good, but when we were
            about to head to the second - where betrayal, manipulation and deceit would be a thing - I didn't want
            these insight checks to completely trivialize any possible plot, specially when three players together
            called them, at least one would end up getting more &geq; 20/25.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to make sure insight remains close to what it is in real life, just one tool among many to sort out
            intrigue and plots, I came up with a simple house rule, the players wouldn't know anymore than their
            characters did - or specifically, they wouldn't know if the insight roll was a NAT 20 or a NAT 1. However,
            should their characters be confused, that's the result the players would be told. This works very well
            with a roll &leq; 5 being something to be afraid of, since a &leq; 5 won't just mean the roll was wasted
            but  actually gave the players a wrong clue instead. I like this approach because it forces players to
            consider / look for clues other than just looking at a guys face, insight checking without any risk, and
            potentially ending the mystery then-and-there with an ~30 roll.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so I went with this -
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a person is speaking normally / the truth, but the players are paranoid, a secret insight roll
                would be made, and compared against a value between 12-16 (typically 13). If it is very close to
                that, the character (and the player) would receive mixed signals, if it is higher, the PC would
                know they are genuine. If it is lower, the PC would feel they are lying instead. The further away
                from 13 it gets, the more confident the PC is in their assessment.<br/>
                <i>13 was chosen as it is the expected value of an insight roll assuming 13 WIS and a half-proficiency
                bonus of 1, which is where I'd place a mature commoner adult. But an adventurer specializing in
                insight could just look at a face and recognize a genuine person when they see one, however they
                could be mistaken against pro liars...</i>
            </li>
            <li>If a person is deliberately lying, and the players are paranoid, a secret insight roll would be
                made against the liar's 'passive deception', which could well mean DC's of &geq; 25 since +17 to a
                trait is easily obtainable for rouges/bards of lv 17 and above (or experienced/magically enhanced
                rouges/bards of lv 13+ or even lv 10+), and advantage gives a +5 to the passive. If their insight
                roll is near the DC, they'll be getting mixed signals, if it's greater then, they'd detect an
                ulterior motive or even outright lies. If it is less than the DC, they'll believe the lie.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I feel this is balanced since a professional liar could probably not be detected that easily, else
           they'd have fallen long ago. But it's not all hopeless, as even the most cunning person would perhaps
           leave behind some clues revealing their nefarious intentions...</p>

        <h4>Escalated Damage Types</h4>
        <p>
            This is one of my attempts to make each damage type more distinct. In my experience, D&D damage types
            lack identity. Just resistances and vulnerabilities are not enough. After they are considered, there's
            virtually no incentive to explore or specialize in different damage types. Specially given the ease of
            availability of one of force, radiant and magical weapon damage for almost each class, characters have
            little reason to pick any other type.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I came up with the concept of escalated damage types. These are very rare, and only found against deadly
            enemies or enemies from very dangerous environments. At their core they deal double damage and apply
            a negative effect, but the way they do that makes them particularly unique and deadly.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If a target is immune to the base damage type, they may or may not be immune to the escalated damage
                type. For instance a construct without a brain that is immune to psychic damage is also immune to neural
                damage. But a demon form the abyss may take hellfire damage even if they are immune to fire damage.
                Resistance means nothing against escalated damage types while vulnerabilities extend.
            </li>
            <li>Base damage is always applied as normal first. So if an attack deals 27 neural damage, the affected
                target would immediately take 27 psychic damage. This is affected by vulnerability / resistance. Let's
                say the target was resistant, so they would 13 psychic damage now.</li>
            <li>Concentration-like checks are then made against total escalated damage since the last failed check.
                Such checks must only be made when the total damage exceeds 20, but the target can willingly choose
                to fail a save whenever they wish to. In the above example, the total damage is 27, so a DC 14 Int
                saving throw is attempted.</li>
            <li>If a concentration-like check is successful, nothing happens, but the damage is tracked. So in the
                above example let's say the target succeeds the save, then takes another 25 neural damage. On the
                second instance, they must make a DC 26 Int save (since the total damage is now 52).</li>
            <li>Should they fail, the total damage stacked up is immediately applied and so is an adverse effect.
                In this case since let's assume the failed the save. So as a result of that attack the damage taken
                is 52 + 25/2 = 64. This abrupt application of damage is what makes escalated damage so deadly,
                since it may easily one-shot rather tanky characters too. Since the damage proc'd was neural,
                the target suffering the damage would also be stunned for 1 round.</li>
            <li>Let's say the victim didn't want this landfall damage, so they could've chosen to fail the save
                immediately when they took the first 27 psychic damage. They'd then have taken 40 psychic damage
                and been stunned. So the tradeoff is that while the damage taken is more gradual (giving allies a chance
                to heal), the negative effect becomes more frequently applied.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some escalated damage types encountered so far are -</p>

            <tr><th>Damage Type</th><th>Escalated Damage Type</th><th>Save Stat</th><th>Fail Effect</th></tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Psychic</td><td>Neural</td><td>INT</td>
                <td>Stunned until the end of the same initiative count in the next round. Paralyzed on the second

                    Any other AC reduction reverts on a long rest. Magical AC is not reduced, but the base 10 AC can
                    be. Death if the base AC falls to zero.</td>

                negative HP exceeds half health and death when it exceeds health.</td>

        <h3>Meta-game rules</h3>
        <p>
            Note: This section of the rules aren't really to do with either the narrative or the system, but are more
            of implementation details I thought I should be clear upon, so that we can all have the best time
            possible with the resources available to us.
        </p>
        <h4>On optimization and Roleplay</h4>
        <p>
            As an optimizer myself, there's no way I'd ever frown on optimization. It's totally fine for players to
            optimize their builds, and they will feel rewarded for optimization by having their character excel in
            whatever they are optimized for. But I would prefer if players build characters with what they want to
            role-play as first in mind as compared to what is mechanically strong. As I've mentioned before, gameplay is
            secondary to narrative in my games, so I'm totally fine with homebrewing something if players (and I) feel
            their character is weaker because of a choice they made for roleplaying's sake. (And the best way to convince
            me would be to present an alternate build with similar resources as your character was built with but with
            better gameplay.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason I mention this specifically is that I will take the rp-aspects of builds as seriously as I
            would take the mechanics, if not more. If someone plays a paladin, they would have to roleplay all the
            oaths. If someone plays a wizard, I will expect them to do some arcane research in character. Conversely, if
            someone plays a melee class, odds are I will not even allow them to attempt arcana checks, as their
            characters would have no idea of most arcane bullshit that can only be found in libraries. If you are a
            Cleric/Druid with 16+ Wis I would very much frown upon roleplaying an edgy character. If you are a warlock,
            well your patron probably owns your soul, and they would use that sometime for their personal gain -
            possibly in ways you, as a player, may not like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following with the character sheet being consistent with RP, I will allow players to 'make trades' with
            their character sheets. Give something up to gain something else. An example that comes to mind is that
            someone may be playing an introvert warlock - whose patron chose them because of their inner force of
            personality, force of will - not because they were good at singing or dancing. If someone wants to rp
            that I'll allow them to give up their charisma bonus to performance (and probably persuasion) in exchange
            for a bonus to Cha saves. I'm not yet fully sure how I'll implement that - but most probably any player
            who wants a trade will list the things they gain/loose, and I'll allocate points (positive or
            negative) to each separately. Then each player would be allowed to add anything from the joint pool of
            traits such that the sum of their points is close to zero.
        </p>
        <h4>Campaign monitoring</h4>
        <p>
            While I was relatively lazy in the previous campaign to go through the character sheets in depth - this
            time I will make sure to give each of them thorough scrutiny pre-session to make sure the gameplay is in
            sync with what's in there. And I would prefer there to the no surprises on the mechanics front. I would
            love to be surprised by how you use what you can do, but hate to be surprised to learn what you can do.
            As such I'd strongly prefer if players tell me upfront what they think they're the strongest moves and
            weakest points are themselves. The stuff they've optimized and the stuff they've dumped.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I said, I like to reward optimization, so you needn't worry that I will design enemies just to bring
            out the weak points of an optimized character. But I will have players commit to a build if they want to
            use it. One example that comes to mind is the free usage of mounts in the first campaign. I've
            no issues in having players with mounts that can fly, climb walls, or zoom past at 120 ft/turn speed,
            but giving them for free seems a disservice to the other players. This time there will be enemies who
            will first target the mount before they take down the character. So if you want to do a mounted gameplay,
            better commit resources into protecting your mount. Likewise, if you want to play a flying character,
            better think of a contingency plan for when you're knocked unconscious in the sky, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing I'll be taking much more seriously in future games is roll fudging. While being honest
            about their dice rolls is something I'd have liked to entrust to players (after all bad rolls offer just
            as good roleplaying opportunities as good ones), I personally want every Nat 20 to be a celebration, to
            all players as well as myself, and that cannot happen, at least for me, if I'm paranoid of whether the
            rolls were fudged. And so, while I allowed the use of beyond20 and irl dice in the first campaign - I'm
            going to crack down on it henceforth.</p>
        <p>
            While I understand the motivations of those using irl dice, and know fudging is definitely not among
            them, I will reserve the right to <i>not</i> allow irl dice for any roll I deem significant.
            Beyond20 is still allowed, but only for rolls that are macros (like you press a button on your sheet and
            auto-generated stuff rolls), examples being an attack/damage roll made together. For arbitrary dice rolls
            - like a simple 2d6 or 1d12 + 1d8 without context, I will not accept anything outside of roll 20.
            Notably, luck rolls are covered in this - only rolls made within r20 are accepted. In return, I won't
            have to do something like making 1 the best result, or choosing 4 random numbers, ever again.
            Furthermore, for any roll made outside roll 20, which comes after a noticeable delay, I reserve the right
            to ask the player to re-roll should I wish to. I will also be going through the roll20 logs and comparing
            them to the D&D Beyond logs arbitrarily, and really hope I do not come across any discrepancies.

                <h4>How does this work?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overall attitude score displayed is the sum of 4 components -  <b>Trust</b>, <b>Gratitude</b>,
                        <b>Respect</b> and <b>Affection</b>. The first three are indicated in the cyclic border
                        around the numbers in the mentioned order going clockwise.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Ratings.</b> Each component can take a rating between [-10, 10]. Negative values are
                        categorized by <b>Paranoia</b>, <b>Envy</b>, <b>Contempt</b> and <b>Hatred</b> respectively.</li>
                    <li><b>Scores.</b> Every component has its score. The Rating is a function of that score. For
                        example, a score between (-3, 3) grants a Rating of 0, one within [3, 7) grants a Rating
                        of 1, [7, 12) grants a Rating of 2, etc.</li>
                    <li>Interactions with an NPC can increase or decrease said scores on one or more axis.</li>
                    <li><b>Attitude zones.</b> Attitude ratings between each component are divided into various
                        zones - like {..., (-4, -1], (-1, 1), [1, 4), [4, 7) ...} etc. The cyclic border's color
                        and opacity for the three components depends on the zone the rating is in. The zone also
                        affects other features described below.</li>
                    <li>Note: The divisions between ratings is <i>not</i> linear. It is far easier to go from 1 respect
                        to 2 respect than it is to go from 9 to 10. Not only is the gap longer, but the effect of
                        favourable actions reduces while unfavourable actions increases at higher zones.</li>
                    <li> <b>Forgiveness.</b> When decent levels of say, <i>Trust</i> are gained, an NPC would simply
                        ignore minor issues which would otherwise have sparked <i>Paranoia</i>. This is handled by
                        having a 'forgiveness buffer' whose size depends on the current rating. The buffer is
                        currently as much as the score needed to attain the next rating. The forgiveness buffer is
                        depleted before actual trust value is lost, and it is replenished before too. The
                        increased/reduced effects of actions at high ratings while affecting score do <u>not</u>
                        apply to the buffer.</li>
                    <li><b>Forgetfulness.</b> The scores of each component individually decay towards zero on a daily
                        basis. This decay is unaffected by the forgiveness buffer and is lower at more extreme zones.
                        The natural decay will never cross a zone boundary. (That was the inspiration for zones in
                        the first place - once you say cross Trust Rating 7, the NPC will make a mental note
                        regarding you as "trusted", after which just the passage of time will not cause them to
                        forget the note.)
