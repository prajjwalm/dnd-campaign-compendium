                        <h4>How does this work?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The overall attitude score displayed is the sum of 4 components -  <b>Trust</b>, <b>Gratitude</b>,
                                <b>Respect</b> and <b>Affection</b>. The first three are indicated in the cyclic border
                                around the numbers in the mentioned order going clockwise.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Ratings.</b> Each component can take a rating between [-10, 10]. Negative values are
                                                categorized by <b>Paranoia</b>, <b>Envy</b>, <b>Contempt</b> and <b>Hatred</b> respectively.</li>
                            <li><b>Scores.</b> Every component has its score. The Rating is a function of that score. For
                                               example, a score between (-3, 3) grants a Rating of 0, one within [3, 7) grants a Rating
                                               of 1, [7, 12) grants a Rating of 2, etc.</li>
                            <li>Interactions with an NPC can increase or decrease said scores on one or more axis.</li>
                            <li><b>Attitude zones.</b> Attitude ratings between each component are divided into various
                                                       zones - like {..., (-4, -1], (-1, 1), [1, 4), [4, 7) ...} etc. The cyclic border's color
                                                       and opacity for the three components depends on the zone the rating is in. The zone also
                                                       affects other features described below.</li>
                            <li>Note: The divisions between ratings is <i>not</i> linear. It is far easier to go from 1 respect
                                to 2 respect than it is to go from 9 to 10. Not only is the gap longer, but the effect of
                                favourable actions reduces while unfavourable actions increases at higher zones.</li>
                            <li> <b>Forgiveness.</b> When decent levels of say, <i>Trust</i> are gained, an NPC would simply
                                                     ignore minor issues which would otherwise have sparked <i>Paranoia</i>. This is handled by
                                                     having a 'forgiveness buffer' whose size depends on the current rating. The buffer is
                                                     currently as much as the score needed to attain the next rating. The forgiveness buffer is
                                                     depleted before actual trust value is lost, and it is replenished before too. The
                                                     increased/reduced effects of actions at high ratings while affecting score do <u>not</u>
                                                     apply to the buffer.</li>
                            <li><b>Forgetfulness.</b> The scores of each component individually decay towards zero on a daily
                                                      basis. This decay is unaffected by the forgiveness buffer and is lower at more extreme zones.
                                                      The natural decay will never cross a zone boundary. (That was the inspiration for zones in
                                                      the first place - once you say cross Trust Rating 7, the NPC will make a mental note
                                                      regarding you as "trusted", after which just the passage of time will not cause them to
                                                      forget the note.)

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Explaining the Shards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sixteen shards govern the entire multiverse. As their name suggests they are fragments, pieces of a whole,
                        pieces of a God who once was, who predated the multiverse these adventures take place in - a God who was killed.
                        Each shard is referred to by an ideal that represents the Shard's primary purpose or motivation. They are the
                        final sources and custodians of all energy, all investiture, all magic, even of all space and time itself. Yet,
                        to function properly, a shard needs a mind to control it, to direct its actions. A mind belonging to a
                        sentient being who 'holds' the shard. Such a person who has taken up the power of a Shard is known as the
                        Vessel of that Shard.<br/>
                        Shards typically choose their vessels, but regardless the intent and nature of the shard eventually become
                        the intent and nature of the vessel, though individuals with strong wills can retain their own
                        personality for long, yet even the strongest of wills would eventually find their ideals being twisted to
                        match the shard they hold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Shards are the most powerful known entities in the multiverse, and for all intents and purposes,
                        serve as its Gods. Most powers that mortals and immortals wield alike come from them. Yet some entities,
                        aberrations of unknown origin, noticeably do not fall under any of their domains and are not allied with
                        any of them, typically. Each shard has a outer plane of their own, though are better linked than others -
                        this generally depends on how well the relations between the vessels are.
                        For example, Leras and Ati were very close before becoming shards, and so it is possible to go directly from
                        the Gardens of Preservation to the Castle of Ruin (but not the other way round) without using
                        perpendicularities. Some shards are even said to share planes. Outer planes typically get moulded
                        following the nature of the Shard. When creatures of the inner planes die, the Shards may choose to
                        summon their souls to their own planes, typically this doesn't involve active action on part of the vessel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite all this, the Shards themselves are almost unknown in the inner planes, and completely unknown in
                        Materia, the material plane that forms the center of the multiverse. Instead, the pantheon that people
                        worship are often aspects of the shard Devotion, who is - behind the veils - the final source of power
                        for 'Gods' and their clerics alike. Similarly, other shards also grant powers to creatures - powers far
                        beyond commoners, powers that give them supernatural abilities. Some shards' powers typically cause their
                        recipients to go down a certain course - like Honor's powers generally give rise to Paladins (aka. Knights
                        Radiant), while Ruin's powers generally produce the greatest Rogues.

                    <h4>The Nature of Investiture</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shardic powers manifest in the realms as investiture. While it may occur in all physical, cognitive and
                        spiritual states, the greatest amount of it is present in its spiritual form. Highly 'invested' people
                        are kept alive by the investiture that has become a part of their souls - becoming one of the reasons
                        why a high enough level barbarian could survive a fall from outer space while a commoner would die if
                        shoved from the fifth floor - even if they had the same hulking body with the same physical anatomy /
                        constitution. Investiture also fuels all the abilities that creatures in the multiverse use -
                        the ki of monks, the spell slots of wizards, etc. all are representations of how much investiture they hold
                        presently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said some investiture also takes physical forms - like Preservation's mists, Ruin's Atium or Honor's
                        'Stormlight' - such investiture can be absorbed by creatures whose souls are invested enough to hold it and
                        used to 'recharge' their abilities or grant them new ones. However, investiture of this form is also
                        generally tied to the shard, and so can only be absorbed by beings with a connection to them. For
                        example, only those bonded with spren can absorb Stormlight, or only those not touched by Ruin (i.e.
                        those not pierced by metal) and gifted by Preservation can benefit from the mists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like the shards, the concepts of investiture is almost unknown in Materia, even if they do make use of it in
                        rather considerable amounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Strangely, a metal yet undiscovered in the Material plane - Aluminium - repels investiture in its pure
                        state. If some investiture is forced into it anyway (the process being a closely guarded secret), then
                        enchanted aluminum becomes a complete void to investiture in all forms.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Honor's Sacrifice</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shards are near-infinite in their command over all physical, mental and spiritual. They can move planets
                        on a whim, their minds are infinitely expanded and can compute the probabilities of various potential
                        routes the future upto centuries may take with near-absolute certainly and they are the owners of all the
                        power that circulate in the multiverse. As mentioned above, for all intents and purposes, each of them is
                        'God'. Yet they stand with conflicting ideals and natures - and so all conflict between mortals, or even
                        immortals, would fade before or be subsumed under a conflict of shards. (Shardic calculations of the
                        future, which approach near vision-level of the future gets greatly obfuscated when another being who can
                        'see' the future - typically another shard - is involved.)<br/>
                        And needless to say, a conflict between shard could've been, and once was near devastating for mortals.
                        Plus given that shards were initially all exactly equal in strength, such a conflict would be seen
                        through to brutal ends, and to an inconclusive result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So like Preservation had long ago given a piece of himself to form sentient life - becoming weaker than Ruin
                        in the process - Honor too made all the shards subject to a pact, a bond, a deal they couldn't refuse
                        (and most didn't even want to) at the cost of making himself weaker than other shards. A pact which made
                        them unable to use their powers to overwhelm a sentient creature from within the multiverse or use their
                        infinite intelligence to trick or outwit it until the creature itself willed so - with full awareness of
                        what they asked for. And so, shards were restricted to achieve their ends through sentient, often mortal,
                        beings - people whom they would grant help and power in exchange for having them become their agents and
                        subject to their authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This pact was made by invoking powers older than, and stronger than, even Shards themselves - and should
                        they violate it, they would immediately become far weaker, and at the mercy of other shards. The same
                        went for all future deals between sentient beings and shards. There would be no tricking or wordplay
                        involved in such deals - both sides would have full awareness of what the other side asked for and intended.
                        Trying to break out of such an oath would weaken the shard by a fair magnitude which depended upon the
                        implications of breaking it. If the opposing side were to willingly break the oath, they would instantly
                        be obliterated - erased from existence itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite that, such agreements, while not common-place, aren't exactly uncommon either. Even after knowing
                        all implications, many mortals find that agreeing is a wiser strategy/tactic than staying away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, eldritch beings from without are not subject to such restrictions...

                <h4>Note</h4>
                <p>Time flows differently in all realms - the more the shardic focus (i.e. the greater the
                   investiture) in a realm / point in space, the faster time moves there. For example time has not moved at
                   all in the outer fringes of the Gardens of Preservation, where no shard focuses. So a day there would be
                   equivalent to a century in Materia.</p>
                <p>At first, time moved slowest in Materia - since the shards all focused on their realms. But as
                   threats from without started to take shape in Materia, and because there was a clash of interests which
                   unfolded there, shards shifted their focus completely over there. This reached a climax during the Silent
                   Age, where time passed in there nearly a dozen times as fast as in the other planes. After that,
                   during the archaic age the shards agreed to step away - causing time in the inner planes to
                   drop till it became around half the pace of the mean of the outer planes.</p>
                <p>However, in the last few centuries, Preservation was weakening, again causing time to go slower in the
                   Gardens. One day there would roughly be a week in Materia. When the Survivor took up the Shard
                   however, he immediately focused on clearing the mess in his domain, which caused time to accelerate
                   rapidly in there causing hours spent in Ruin equivalent to weeks in the Gardens.</p>

                <h3>In game rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Disclaimer: These rules are based on what I felt should be appropriate based on previous experience.
                    While I will generally stick to them, I may occasionally change them based on how the gameplay feels.
                    Most of these are addons and interpretations, and should change anything to fundamental to the system.
                    These take the last spot because they are entirely system dependant - and not really of much significance
                    to the campaign itself. I may change the system, but the characters/shards would remain, while these all
                    would become obsolete. To me the system is secondary to the narrative and world building. As
                    such I am also typically chill with homebrew as long as I feel it won't reduce the fun other people,
                    including myself, are having. <br/>
                    Of course, I will continue to add stuff here as we go along.
                </p>

                <h4>AoE attacks with a hit roll</h4>
                <p>
                    Most of the times attacks targeting multiple creatures require saving throws, which typically makes
                    sense. However, in rare cases, there may be attacks which I feel can cover multiple creatures in their
                    impact, yet would be resisted by a sturdy piece of plate armor. Simple examples being the hail of machine
                    gun fire or a sweeping blade of a giant. In such case I'll make a single attack roll which would apply to
                    the primary target(s) and an amount (typically 0, 2 or 5) subtracted from the roll would apply to
                    secondary targets in range.
                </p>
                <h4>Continuous Damage</h4>
                <p>If an effect deals continuous damage, it is approximated dealing D<sub>1</sub> damage in
                   initiative counts 24, 16 and 8 and D<sub>2</sub> at initiative count 0, where,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>D<sub>1</sub> is total damage / 4, rounded down.</li>
                    <li>D<sub>2</sub> is total damage - 3 &times; D<sub>1</sub>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Hero Points</h4>
                <p>As the protagonists of the game there might be certain points where you might not want to leave things to
                   rng and instead reinforce yourselves in heroic moments. So from now on, I'll be giving each pc a certain
                   amount of hero points - an amount dependent on the length of the campaign and how major a role I want your
                   PCs to play.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use any number of dice to add or subtract to a roll involving your character in any way.</li>
                    <li>The first dice is worth as many hero points you started with in total. All subsequent dice are
                        worth one less than the previous.</li>
                    <li>So, if you had, say, 7 hero points. You could use them all at once to get a total of &plusmn; 28 in a
                        single roll, probably upsetting the will of a God, or use them to get &plusmn;7 in 7 different rolls,
                        or anything in between.</li>
                    <li>These will not replenish in any way whatsoever.</li>
                    <li>You can use these in any rolls whatsoever. (Luck rolls will be d100s in the future)</li>
                    <li>These add to the NAT roll, and may potentially exceed the max of the dice. And so, for combat
                        purposes, any NAT roll &geq; 20 is considered a critical hit in to-hit rolls, and a NAT roll &leq; 1
                        is an auto-miss.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Note that unlike the DMG variant, these do not replenish on level ups. But they grant a much more
                   powerful bonus to any roll, and stacking is an option. So use them wisely.</p>

                <h4>Graded rolls</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike the others, this is not entirely homebrew. At times we want effects from a powerful creature where
                    we can't have the DC as per the usual formula (not much fun saying you die if you fail a DC 27 save...).
                    So like the medusa, several high CR monsters' attacks with ridiculous DCs would have only minor effects if
                    you fail the save by a small amount, and increasingly traumatic effects if you fail by more than a
                    certain amount.
                </p>

                <h4>Honor, Sanity, Wis, Cha</h4>
                <p>
                    Personally, I always found myself confused by when to use Wis vs Cha saving throws. So I decided to
                    use the DMG's Honor and Sanity scores to resolve this confusion. Again, any rules I say here are my
                    interpretation and may appear ridiculous to others, so I'll include the official words to try to reason
                    out my homebrew distinction.
                </p>
                <h6>Official Rules (DMG)</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wis Saves.</b> <i>"Resisting effects that charm, frighten, or otherwise assault your willpower".</i>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Cha Saves.</b> <i>"Withstanding effects, such as possession, that would subsume your personality or
                                             hurl you to another plane of existence".</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Now to me, "assault your willpower" and "subsume your personality" sound way too close / ambiguous in
                    certain contexts. Willpower I interpret as a measure of how much you can make yourself do something you
                    must do even when your mind rebels against you. Will, the same, but towards a specific goal. Lacking them
                    means you will waver in your intent (a crucial, perhaps the most crucial, part of your personality) when
                    put under pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add to the confusion, Paladins, a class that literally derives its power from oaths, use Charisma.
                    Oaths to me are the ultimate expression of willpower. To declare words/ideals which you will always
                    follow no matter how much your mind, your instincts, even your very soul would crave otherwise. Also,
                    quoting from the Stormlight Archive,
                </p>
                <p class="cool_intro">
                    "There are no foolish oaths. All are the mark of men and true spren over beasts and subspren. The mark of
                    intelligence, free will, and choice."
                </p>
                <h6>Final Rules</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Honor.</b> (aka Willpower)
                                      A skill whose base value equals your <u>Charisma Save</u>. This score would be used to force
                                      yourself to do something when your body or mind rebels against it. While this would be called as a
                                      saving throw most of the time, players can also request a roll of their own violation to resist, in a
                                      reduced way, the symptoms of effects like fear etc. Players may declare a <u>will</u>, something they
                                      really, really want from their very soul. On Honor rolls aligning with their will, players will have
                                      advantage, on those going against it, they'll have disadvantage.<br/>
                                      Note that the more willpower is used, the greater strain it puts on the mind. And characters might make
                                      themselves depressed/tired on overuse, particularly on failed rolls, whose mechanical effects I would
                                      decide when needed.<br/>
                                      However, successful rolls, particularly in situations that matter, might also eventually grant players
                                      an increase to the modifier itself.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Sanity.</b>
                        A skill whose base value equals your <u>Wisdom save</u>. This score would be used only in save-like
                        situations, though often out of combat. It would denote how much you can hold on to your mind when
                        exposed to the utterly alien/aberrant/powerful, such as the focus of an elder (or worse) nightmare,
                        reading the more infernal plays of
                        <span class="card_link" data-index-key="[character|Logos]">The Playwright</span>,
                        or encountering a more potent vision of a Shard than the mind can handle.<br/>
                        Failed rolls will generally incur forms of madness or other insanity, but in more severe cases can lead
                        to more drastic effects. For example, being exposed to the full form of an outsider might cause a
                        feeblemind while being exposed to the full form of a shard, if it were possible, would be instant
                        death.<br/>
                        The modifier to this roll also can increase, it increases the more a character is exposed to, in a
                        'vaccine-like' manner. It may also decrease when exposed in a harsher way, and greatly decrease if the
                        save made to resist it fails.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Saves.</b>
                        So what do I use the saves for? Firstly and majorly, in combat. Occasionally, I may use them for the
                        effects listed in DMG instead of honor/sanity. Wisdom saves will be used to keep your cool, like
                        when being charmed (which might include being forced into wrath/bloodlust). Like in the case of
                        partly resisting fear, effects of a failed wisdom save could typically be reduced or even nullified by a
                        successful subsequent Honor roll, but that would put some strain on the mind. Charisma saves will be
                        made to resist personality changes on a core level - like an alignment switch. A rule of thumb will
                        be that wisdom saves would target the immediate, while charisma saves would target the long term.

                <h4>Rests and Natural healing</h4>
                <p>
                    The reason heroes can fall from 150ft in the air, get slashed on the gut with a longsword and then be up and
                    about after a good night's sleep without any healing magic is because of the investiture their bodies hold,
                    which allows them to take damage that normally would kill a person. This means that the replenishment of
                    their investiture overnight is what natural healing entails. This also means that in areas of reduced
                    investiture, natural healing would suffer. Normally, this doesn't affect the game and we can follow the
                    basic rules just as usual (since all campaigns happen in the outer planes with a good amount of
                    investiture), but in areas of low, high investiture we'd adopt different rule-sets.

                <h4>On Insight checks</h4>
                <p>
                    Here its probably better if I start with the inspiration for this. So in my experience of the first arc
                    of the first campaign, players would "insight check this" everytime an npc said something, or even
                    appeared to be, remotely suspicious. Now the npcs of the first arc were generally good, but when we were
                    about to head to the second - where betrayal, manipulation and deceit would be a thing - I didn't want
                    these insight checks to completely trivialize any possible plot, specially when three players together
                    called them, at least one would end up getting more &geq; 20/25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, to make sure insight remains close to what it is in real life, just one tool among many to sort out
                    intrigue and plots, I came up with a simple house rule, the players wouldn't know anymore than their
                    characters did - or specifically, they wouldn't know if the insight roll was a NAT 20 or a NAT 1. However,
                    should their characters be confused, that's the result the players would be told. This works very well
                    with a roll &leq; 5 being something to be afraid of, since a &leq; 5 won't just mean the roll was wasted
                    but  actually gave the players a wrong clue instead. I like this approach because it forces players to
                    consider / look for clues other than just looking at a guys face, insight checking without any risk, and
                    potentially ending the mystery then-and-there with an ~30 roll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so I went with this -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a person is speaking normally / the truth, but the players are paranoid, a secret insight roll
                        would be made, and compared against a value between 12-16 (typically 13). If it is very close to
                        that, the character (and the player) would receive mixed signals, if it is higher, the PC would
                        know they are genuine. If it is lower, the PC would feel they are lying instead. The further away
                        from 13 it gets, the more confident the PC is in their assessment.<br/>
                        <i>13 was chosen as it is the expected value of an insight roll assuming 13 WIS and a half-proficiency
                           bonus of 1, which is where I'd place a mature commoner adult. But an adventurer specializing in
                           insight could just look at a face and recognize a genuine person when they see one, however they
                           could be mistaken against pro liars...</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>If a person is deliberately lying, and the players are paranoid, a secret insight roll would be
                        made against the liar's 'passive deception', which could well mean DC's of &geq; 25 since +17 to a
                        trait is easily obtainable for rouges/bards of lv 17 and above (or experienced/magically enhanced
                        rouges/bards of lv 13+ or even lv 10+), and advantage gives a +5 to the passive. If their insight
                        roll is near the DC, they'll be getting mixed signals, if it's greater then, they'd detect an
                        ulterior motive or even outright lies. If it is less than the DC, they'll believe the lie.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I feel this is balanced since a professional liar could probably not be detected that easily, else
                   they'd have fallen long ago. But it's not all hopeless, as even the most cunning person would perhaps
                   leave behind some clues revealing their nefarious intentions...</p>

                <h4>Escalated Damage Types</h4>
                <p>
                    This is one of my attempts to make each damage type more distinct. In my experience, D&D damage types
                    lack identity. Just resistances and vulnerabilities are not enough. After they are considered, there's
                    virtually no incentive to explore or specialize in different damage types. Specially given the ease of
                    availability of one of force, radiant and magical weapon damage for almost each class, characters have
                    little reason to pick any other type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I came up with the concept of escalated damage types. These are very rare, and only found against deadly
                    enemies or enemies from very dangerous environments.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If a target is immune to the base damage type, they may or may not be immune to the escalated damage
                        type. For instance a construct without a brain that is immune to psychic damage is also immune to neural
                        damage. But a demon form the abyss may take hellfire damage even if they are immune to fire damage.
                        <i>Resistance means nothing against escalated damage types</i> while vulnerabilities extend.
                    </li>
                    <li>Everytime an instance of escalated damage is taken a <b>DC 20 Save</b> (except when mentioned explicitly)
                        must be attempted to resist the negative
                        effects of this damage type. Depending on how much total damage has been so far this save can either be
                        at advantage (<25), regular (<50) or at disadvantage (<100). After a total of 100 damage since the last
                        failed save has been taken, the save is considered an auto fail.</li>
                    <li>Upon a failed save, 10 true damage is taken and a negative side effect is applied.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Some escalated damage types encountered so far are -</p>

                <h4>Skill Improvement [CoC]</h4>
                <p>The traditional CoC skill improvement via training rules are focused on university / personal courses
                   spanning months. As far as skill improvement via usage is concerned, they're written from the PoV of an
                   experienced modern-era investigator who'd focus on skills they already know. Neither of the two seemed,
                   in my opinion, to form good mechanics to simulate how a renaissance fellow would learn how to use a
                   computer the first time they were exposed to it.
                </p>
                <p>And so I decided to make alternate rule-sets for skill improvement. I'll list the motivations I had and I
                   hope these will be comprehensive, simple enough and balanced, though I am open to revise them based on
                   player feedback and play testing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
                        <b>Successful roll based improvement.</b>
                        Allowing the same amount of improvement on a single successful roll as that of a four-month course
                        doesn't seem wise. Since rolls are commonly used for roleplay purposes even for situations where a
                        character wouldn't learn something new on success, allowing this would either require me clamping down
                        on rolls (breaking roleplay) or have players actively seek out as much variety of rolls as they can.
                        <br/>
                        While I realize the latter is probably the motivation for this ruling, I decided that a skill should
                        really improve on a successful roll only if the situation is tense and the character delivers. So
                        here's what I rule -
                        <ul>
                            <li>On a successful roll where it was needed, the PC gets a skill improvement chance for exactly 1
                                point.</li>
                            <li>If a hard roll was needed, and a hard (or better) success was achieved, the PC gets 2
                                skill improvement chances for upto 1 &times; d10 points in total.</li>
                            <li>If an extreme roll was needed, and an extreme (or better) success was achieved, the PC gets 5
                                skill improvement chances for upto 2 &times; d10 points in total.</li>
                            <li>If a critical roll was needed, and a critical success was achieved, the PC gets 10
                                skill improvement chances for upto 4 &times; d10 points in total.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Highlighting that I'm standing by the rule that if luck was spent to make a success, it doesn't count
                        for improvement. However, this doesn't count for the usage of 'Hero points' as mentioned above. For
                        instance, if a critical success was needed, and the dice rolled a 12, the usage of two 'Hero points'
                        would make it count as a critical success achieved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Training based improvement.</b>
                        This was much more complicated to sort out because of the various things that might affect a session
                        of training. Also, the base rules had very little to say about this, and so I'll be much more receptive
                        to feedback here. For the purposes of the rules below, consider the following table (will be
                        elaborated in the points below) -

                                This, in my opinion, can affect learning in two ways. One is what CoC already accounts for -
                                the more you know of a subject, the harder it is to master what you don't know. But there is
                                also another aspect to this, the more you know of the subject, the better placed you are to
                                delve deeper into it and train yourself. But this second aspect can also apply to related
                                subjects (e.g. someone very proficient with Math or Computers will have an easier time learning
                                Cryptography), and I'll cover it in the next point. The first point remains the same, i.e. -<br/>
                                <em>Every skill improvement roll first requires a d100 check (potentially) with some modifiers.
                                    The skill improves only if this d100 is greater than the current ability score (minus a
                                    modifier dependent on the trainer as elaborated below). </em>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Own skill in related subjects.</b>
                                This captures the second effect mentioned above. If you're already good in your skill of
                                expertise, you're probably better placed to dig deeper into harder topics. For training, you
                                may attempt a roll in the subject you're trying to improve and two highly related subjects.
                                If you attain the requisite success in that subject (as mentioned in the table above), you
                                get a bonus skill improvement chance+roll. For the related subjects, the success must be one
                                degree harder. For example, lets say your Computers is 70, and you're trying to leverage your
                                Math knowledge to improve in it further during a training course. You're going to need an
                                extreme success in Math to get another improvement chance+roll.

                                surely going to be useful. Also say you're trying to improve your Computers, well you might
                                have an easier job of it if you were taught by Ritchie/Kernighan (since I'm sure no one knows
                                who they are - they're the dudes who created the C language, to which majority of the
                                programming languages used today trace their roots to. They literally shifted the era from
                                assembly-like coding to coding as we know today.).<br/>
                                When being taught by a trainer and or holding an inanimate object which would make learning
                                easier, the modifier needed to succeed in the skill improvement d100 is reduced by a value
                                <b>upto</b> their 'score', which is determined by their skill

                <h4>Research Activities [Beta]</h4>
                <p>Research related activities (studying an ancient text or developing a new spell) will typically require a
                good number of rolls over a long period of time, during which a percentage of the day's time must be devoted to
                the task. The rolls needed embody two different aspects of gruelling research - i. the slow, patient effort and
                hard work that must be spared over a period of time, and, ii. solving some very particular academic obstacles
                to progress past certain blocks (eureka moments).

                <p>
                    A character attempting to research a particular task would need to clear a long sequence of DCs which would
                    typically range from dozens to perhaps even hundreds in count. Obviously, they do not need to roll for every single
                    DC. Instead, they'll be making two rolls -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Weekly form.</b>
                        This roll embodies how good the character is performing that week. Any DCs required which are beneath this
                        roll are automatically considered succeeded (after modifiers to the roll are applied). <em>Since this is
                        a long term roll, while it may be subject to advantage/disadvantage or flat modifiers at times, roll modifiers
                        like guidance or portent would not apply.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Eureka rolls.</b>
                        When a sequence in the DCs is encountered which is harder than the weekly form, the character will find
                        themselves stuck. Then they will not progress till they can clear that DC in particular. To resolve this,
                        players can use every tool in their arsenal, like guidance/portent/enhance ability etc.

                    Consider the following case. the wizard Zeph is developing a first level frost spell. He would be needing to clear a series
                    of arcana checks (after clearing other requisites, which would be non-trivial but aren't relevant here), which in this case
                    are 9 rolls summing to a total of 120.
                    Every week he'd roll once for weekly form and, whenever he's stuck in a problem, he'd be rolling everyday till he

                <p><b>Note.</b> The distribution, difficulty and count of checks needed would largely depend on the difficulty of the research.
                                As an arbitrary example, if a spell being developed, the DCs would be significantly harder if it were being targeted as a 3<sup>rd</sup> level spell
                                instead of a 4<sup>th</sup> level, assuming all other parameters are the same.</p>
                <h3>Meta-game rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Note: This section of the rules aren't really to do with either the narrative or the system, but are more
                    of implementation details I thought I should be clear upon, so that we can all have the best time
                    possible with the resources available to us.

                <h4>On optimization and Roleplay</h4>
                <p>
                    As an optimizer myself, there's no way I'd ever frown on optimization. It's totally fine for players to
                    optimize their builds, and they will feel rewarded for optimization by having their character excel in
                    whatever they are optimized for. But I would prefer if players build characters with what they want to
                    role-play as first in mind as compared to what is mechanically strong. As I've mentioned before, gameplay is
                    secondary to narrative in my games, so I'm totally fine with homebrewing something if players (and I) feel
                    their character is weaker because of a choice they made for roleplaying's sake. (And the best way to convince
                    me would be to present an alternate build with similar resources as your character was built with but with
                    better gameplay.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason I mention this specifically is that I will take the rp-aspects of builds as seriously as I
                    would take the mechanics, if not more. If someone plays a paladin, they would have to roleplay all the
                    oaths. If someone plays a wizard, I will expect them to do some arcane research in character. Conversely, if
                    someone plays a melee class, odds are I will not even allow them to attempt arcana checks, as their
                    characters would have no idea of most arcane bullshit that can only be found in libraries. If you are a
                    Cleric/Druid with 16+ Wis I would very much frown upon roleplaying an edgy character. If you are a warlock,
                    well your patron probably owns your soul, and they would use that sometime for their personal gain -
                    possibly in ways you, as a player, may not like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following with the character sheet being consistent with RP, I will allow players to 'make trades' with
                    their character sheets. Give something up to gain something else. An example that comes to mind is that
                    someone may be playing an introvert warlock - whose patron chose them because of their inner force of
                    personality, force of will - not because they were good at singing or dancing. If someone wants to rp
                    that I'll allow them to give up their charisma bonus to performance (and probably persuasion) in exchange
                    for a bonus to Cha saves. I'm not yet fully sure how I'll implement that - but most probably any player
                    who wants a trade will list the things they gain/loose, and I'll allocate points (positive or
                    negative) to each separately. Then each player would be allowed to add anything from the joint pool of
                    traits such that the sum of their points is close to zero.
                </p>
                <h4>Campaign monitoring</h4>
                <p>
                    While I was relatively lazy in the previous campaign to go through the character sheets in depth - this
                    time I will make sure to give each of them thorough scrutiny pre-session to make sure the gameplay is in
                    sync with what's in there. And I would prefer there to the no surprises on the mechanics front. I would
                    love to be surprised by how you use what you can do, but hate to be surprised to learn what you can do.
                    As such I'd strongly prefer if players tell me upfront what they think they're the strongest moves and
                    weakest points are themselves. The stuff they've optimized and the stuff they've dumped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like I said, I like to reward optimization, so you needn't worry that I will design enemies just to bring
                    out the weak points of an optimized character. But I will have players commit to a build if they want to
                    use it. One example that comes to mind is the free usage of mounts in the first campaign. I've
                    no issues in having players with mounts that can fly, climb walls, or zoom past at 120 ft/turn speed,
                    but giving them for free seems a disservice to the other players. This time there will be enemies who
                    will first target the mount before they take down the character. So if you want to do a mounted gameplay,
                    better commit resources into protecting your mount. Likewise, if you want to play a flying character,
                    better think of a contingency plan for when you're knocked unconscious in the sky, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing I'll be taking much more seriously in future games is roll fudging. While being honest
                    about their dice rolls is something I'd have liked to entrust to players (after all bad rolls offer just
                    as good roleplaying opportunities as good ones), I personally want every Nat 20 to be a celebration, to
                    all players as well as myself, and that cannot happen, at least for me, if I'm paranoid of whether the
                    rolls were fudged. And so, while I allowed the use of beyond20 and irl dice in the first campaign - I'm
                    going to crack down on it henceforth.</p>
                <p>
                    While I understand the motivations of those using irl dice, and know fudging is definitely not among
                    them, I will reserve the right to <i>not</i> allow irl dice for any roll I deem significant.
                    Beyond20 is still allowed, but only for rolls that are macros (like you press a button on your sheet and
                    auto-generated stuff rolls), examples being an attack/damage roll made together. For arbitrary dice rolls
                    - like a simple 2d6 or 1d12 + 1d8 without context, I will not accept anything outside of roll 20.
                    Notably, luck rolls are covered in this - only rolls made within r20 are accepted. In return, I won't
                    have to do something like making 1 the best result, or choosing 4 random numbers, ever again.
                    Furthermore, for any roll made outside roll 20, which comes after a noticeable delay, I reserve the right
                    to ask the player to re-roll should I wish to. I will also be going through the roll20 logs and comparing
                    them to the D&D Beyond logs arbitrarily, and really hope I do not come across any discrepancies.
